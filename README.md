1. Why is JavaScript important in web development?
JavaScript makes websites dynamic and interactive. It allows content updates, user interactions, animations, and communication with servers without reloading the page.
2. Difference between var, let, and const?
var is outdated, function-scoped, and can be re-declared.
let is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared.
const is block-scoped and cannot be changed after assignment.
3. What happens if you use a variable before declaring it?
var is hoisted but initialized as undefined.
let and const are hoisted but not initialized, causing an error if accessed before declaration.
